#About EHRI-UK

The [European Holocaust Research Infrastructure](https://www.ehri-project.eu) (EHRI) is an international infrastructure 
securing Holocaust research, commemoration and education on a trans-national level.
EHRI-UK is the national node representing the United Kingdom within this international
research consortium. EHRI-UK will seek to ensure the long-term sustainability of Holocaust
research within the UK and beyond by:

* representing institutions within the UK (and Crown Dependencies) which contain materials related to Holocaust 
Studies to create a strong research consortium;
* connecting resources through a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure;
* developing innovative digital research tools;
* offering fellowships and training opportunities for researchers, archivists, and heritage professionals.

EHRI's impact is primarily scientific, however, the infrastructure also advances a wider 
social and political agenda. The recent rise of antisemitism, xenophobia and aggressive
nationalisms in Europe and beyond demonstrate that Holocaust research is never a purely
academic concern, but a prerequisite for open and non-discriminatory societies across
Europe and beyond.
